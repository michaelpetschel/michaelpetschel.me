# Give Up on Giving Up

> I have been through the ups and downs of life.  
> I have lived the best and worst man can imagine.  
> I have seen war, poverty, disease, and death.  
> I watch it unfold and consume the lives of us all.  
> And after it all; All of it, I have two words still remaining with me.  
> 
> These words are the reason I’m still here.  
> The reason I haven’t given up.  
> Not on hope, not on friends or family, and definitely not on life.  
> **Want to know these words?**  
> 
> ### Never Stop  
> ### Never stop.  
> Never stop hoping, moving, pushing back.  
> When you feel down, remember you can get up.  
> And you will always be able to.  
> 
> And when you think that it’s time to give up,  
> **Give up, on giving up.**
