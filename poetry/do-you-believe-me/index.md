## Do You Believe Me?

**Do you know who you are?**
I definitely don’t.
To me you are just the reader of my words.
But to someone somewhere you mean something.

Now you need to make a choice.
**Do you believe me?**
Do you believe you mean something?
Or that others appreciate you?

I don’t know you, but you do.
So think right now.
Think really hard about this.
**Do you believe me?**

I want you to remember that you are loved.
You are valued.
You are appreciated.
**You mean something.**

Did you know you have a purpose?
Do you believe me?
Whether you see it or not you have a purpose.
**Now you have to find it.**
